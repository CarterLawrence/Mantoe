-Yes, because it changes their delivery method

3. What does incremental delivery mean?
-Team release a potentially shippable software at the end of each sprint.

4. How many people do you suggest involve in the scrum team.
-plus or minus around 7 people is the rule of thumb so 5 to 9 people is best
